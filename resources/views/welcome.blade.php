                                Kickfurther is a company that presents potential "Buyers" with opportunities to earn income by purchasing inventory from "Brands".
                                <br />
                                A "Brand" is a Consumer Product Business which presents the public the opportunity to purchase inventory and earn consignment income if the purchased inventory sells.
                                <br />
                                A "Buyer" is a person who crowdfunds the purchase of inventory for a Kickfurther Brand, and can promote the brand and sell that inventory.
                                <br />
                                A "Co-op" (short for "Consignment Opportunity") represents a consignment agreement proposed by a Brand to the Buyers in the Kickfurther community. Under these agreements, Brands present certain products for purchase and resale as consignment inventory. When the consignment inventory sells, the Buyers earn income.
                                <br />
                                A "Purchase" is an entity that represents the participation of a Buyer in a Co-op.
                                <br />
                                A "Transaction" represents the movement of money. When a purchase is done, the financial information should be held in its own transacton. The same logic applies for refunds.

                                    <li>If the coop was successfully canceled, notify the coop's owner about what happened. Owners shouldn't be notified if the coop doesn't receive any modifications.</li>

                                        <li>if the credit card has already been charged, refund the money according to the buyer's refund preference ("credit" or "cc"). For CC refunds use the Stripe helper classes provided.</li>
